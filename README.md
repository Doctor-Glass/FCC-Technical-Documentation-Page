# FreeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Project

This repository serves to hold my project for the Technical Documentation Page assignment in the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. It currently consists of a single webpage and a single CSS stylesheet, though I may add more later if I decide to.

## Why I Chose This Subject

The objective of the project is to write a technical documentation page for a subject of my choice. I chose to write a guide on how to fit ships in EVE Online, a MMORPG that I play a lot of. My reasons for choosing this subject include:

- My knowledge on the subject (I have been playing the game since 2016 and have developed a significant knowledge base on the subject)
- The relative complexity of the subject, offering the opportunity for detail
- The necessity of the project, since the subject is a complex one and it's often difficult for new players to access a large body of knowledge all in one place

## Project Criteria

The following are the criteria for this project, provided by FreeCodeCamp:

```
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks. Do not copy this demo project.

User Stories:

1. You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
2. Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
3. The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
4. Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")
5. The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
6. The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
7. The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)
8. You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
9. The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section
11. The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
12. Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
13. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
15. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

Note: Be sure to add <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS
```

This project passes all tests for the assignment.

The assignment can be found at [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-technical-documentation-page-project/build-a-technical-documentation-page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-technical-documentation-page-project/build-a-technical-documentation-page).
The project is not currently hosted anywhere, but I plan to host it for public view and perhaps build it into a full website later on down the road.
